## Interpretation and Limitations

### Summary of Results

In this experiment, I compared three prompting techniques (zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot) on medical questions related to gout. The best performing technique was **one-shot prompting** with an average score of 0.08.

### Key Findings

1. Overall performance was poor across all prompting techniques, with very low keyword matching scores.
2. One-shot prompting showed slight improvement for certain questions, particularly about whether gout can be cured.
3. Few-shot prompting did not improve performance despite providing more examples.

### Limitations

The experiment has several significant limitations:

1. **Model Selection**: I was only able to use the facebook/bart-large-cnn model due to limitations of the free Hugging Face API access. This model was primarily trained to summarize news articles, not to answer medical questions. More specialized models like PubMedBERT or Bio_ClinicalBERT would likely produce better results but were not accessible.

2. **Evaluation Method**: The keyword-based evaluation is simplistic and doesn't capture nuance or alternative phrasings that might be medically accurate but use different terminology.

3. **Data Quality**: The poor performance likely reflects the mismatch between the model's training and the specialized medical domain rather than the effectiveness of different prompting techniques themselves.

4. **Sample Size**: The experiment only used five questions about a single medical condition (gout), which limits the generalizability of the findings.

### Conclusion

While one-shot prompting performed marginally better in this experiment, the overall low scores suggest that the underlying model's capabilities matter more than the prompting technique when dealing with specialized domains like healthcare.
