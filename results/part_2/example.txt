# LLM Chat Tool Test Results

## IMPORTANT MEDICAL DISCLAIMER

**WARNING: The responses generated by this LLM are NOT medically accurate and should NOT be used for healthcare decisions.**

The facebook/bart-large-cnn model used was primarily trained to summarize news articles, not to provide medical advice. The responses may contain incorrect and incomplete information about symptoms, diagnoses, and treatments. Due to using a free language model, not all answers will be available from the website as it is a public site.

For this assignment, with the free Hugging Face API account, I was only able to get access to the bart-cnn model which is a low-quality language model.
The more advanced models (flan-T5, gpt2, PubMedBERT, Bio_ClinicalBERT, etc.) were unable to be accessed (404 errors/permission denied) due to using the free account.

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Run the one-off chat
python utils/one_off_chat.py

# Run the contextual chat
python utils/conversation.py
